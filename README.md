# STM8S eForth (stm8ef)

TG9541/STM8EF is an extends [Dr. C.H. Ting's eForth for the *STM8S Discovery*](http://www.forth.org/svfig/kk/07-2010.html). It aims to be a very lightweight embedded "untethered" Forth system for low-end STM8 µCs with a maximum "feature-to-binary-size" ratio. TG9541/STM8EF is published as Free Open Source Software ([license](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/blob/master/LICENSE.md)) with the kind permission of the original author.

The project has the following goals:

1. provide an easy to use [Forth kit](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-eForth-Programming) for STM8 µCs
2. board support for [common low-cost Chinese control boards](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-Value-Line-Gadgets)
3. maximize the product *features* * *free space* for low-end STM8 *Value Line* µCs (see below)
4. create a development environment, libraries, and encourage community support

# Board support:

TG9541/STM8EF provides board support for several common "Chinese gadgets", and for generic targets:

* [W1209](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Board-W1209) low-cost thermostat w/ 3 digit 7S-LED display, full- or half-duplex RS232
* [W1219](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Board-W1219) low cost thermostat with 2x3 digit 7S-LED display, half-duplex RS232 through PD1/SWIM

* [C0135](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Board-C0135) "Relay-4 Board" (can be used as a *Nano PLC*)
* [DCDC](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Board-CN2596) hacked DCDC converter with voltmeter

## Other Supported Gadgets

The Wiki lists other supported "[Value Line Gadgets](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-Value-Line-Gadgets)", e.g. [voltmeters & power supplies](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-Value-Line-Gadgets#voltmeters-and-power-supplies), [breakout boards](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Breakout-Boards), and [thermostats](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-Value-Line-Gadgets#thermostats).

## STM8S003F3 Core

A plain STM8S003F3P6 eForth core with a lean scripting oriented vocabulary (words like AHEAD or [COMPILE] not linked), and a minimal memory footprint (less than 4KiB Flash). CORE can be used as-is or as a starting point for new configurations.

* Selected features:
  * 16MHz HSI
  * compile to Flash
  * lightweight low-level interrupt handlers in Forth code

More features can be selected from the list of options in `globalconf.inc`.

Run `make BOARD=CORE flash` for building and flashing.

## STM8S003F3 "Communication through PD1/SWIM"

This is a generic STM8EF target for exploring boards where no UART pins are broken out but where PD1 is available on a SWIM ICP header. Access to PD5/TX and PD6/RX is not required, bus-style half-duplex console communciation with a software UART simulation is used instead.

* Selected features (superset of CORE):
  * any port pin can be configured for half-duplex RS232 (standard: PD1/SWIM)
  * EEPROM access
  * background task
  * eForth extensions *CREATE-DOES>*, *DO-LEAVE-LOOP/+LOOP*
  * bit addressing
  * case-insensitive vocabulary
* Binary size below 5100 bytes

For serial communication the following simple wired-or interface can be used:

```

STM8 device    .      .----o serial TxD "TTL"
               .      |      (e.g. "CH340 USB serial converter")
               .     ---
               .     / \  1N4148
               .     ---
               .      |
STM8 PD1/SWIM-->>-----*----o serial RxD "TTL
               .
GND------------>>----------o serial GND
               .
................
```

Run `make BOARD=SWIMCOM flash` for building and flashing.

## Steps for creating a new board variant

For creating a variant, copy and rename a base variant folder (e.g. CORE). By running `make BOARD=<folderName> flash` will be compiled and programmed to the target. Other STM8 variants can be supported by a putting a matching `stm8device.inc` file into the board folder.

It's advisable to have at least two boards for reverse engineering: one in original state, and one for testing new code. Please [open a ticket here](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/issues), or contact the STM8EF [Hackaday.io project](https://hackaday.io/project/16097-eforth-for-cheap-stm8s-value-line-gadgets) before you start working on a new board!

**Warning**:  the original ROM contents of most boards is read-protected and can't be read, and once erased the original function can't be restored (your board will be useless unless you write your own code).

**Warning**: if your target board is designed to supply or control connected devices (e.g. a power supply unit) it's recommended not to assume fail-safe properties of the board (e.g. the output voltage of a power supply board might rise to the maximum without the proper software). Disconnect any connected equipment, and if possible only supply the µC with a current limiting power supply!

**Warning**: when working with unknown boards make sure to have at least a basic understanding of the schematics and workings of the board! The author(s) of this software can't help you reverse-engineering an unsupported board. Working knowledge of electronics engineering is assumed.

# Support for STM8S Value Line and Access Line

The availability of low-cost boards (e.g. thermostats, power supplies, WIFI modules) makes the *STM8S003F3P6* the main target.

Differences between STM8S003F3P6 and STM8S105C6T6 (*STM8S Discovery*) are:

* 8 KiB Flash instead of 32 KiB
* 1 KiB RAM instead of 2 KiB
* 128 bytes EEPROM instead of 1 KiB (the STM8S103F3 has 640 bytes)
* reduced set of GPIO and other peripherals
* UART1 instead of UART2

Other changes to the original code:

* use of the free SDCC tool chain ("ASxxxx V2.0" syntax, SDCC linker with declaration of ISR routines in `main.c`)
* the [SDCC toolchain](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) allows mixing Forth, assembly, and C
* removal of hard STM8S105C6 dependencies (e.g. RAM layout, UART2)
* flexible RAM layout, meaningful symbols for RAM locations
* conditional code for different target boards with a subdirectory based configuration framework
* bug fixes (e.g. COMPILE, DEPTH, R!)
* significant binary size reduction
